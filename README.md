# Gauchospace Lasso

This Google Chrome extension is for Gauchospace, a Moodle installation in use
by UCSB students.

It provides two pieces of functionality that are useful to me.

* No more "Your session has timed out.  Please login again.". If the form has
  been autofilled and if that message appears then the extension will
  automatically log you in. 

* Save As... now works for documents other than PDFs. You can now "Save As..."
  Word, Powerpoint, and probably Excel documents.
